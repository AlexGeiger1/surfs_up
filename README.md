# Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to examine temperature data for the months of December and June at the island of Oahu in Hawaii. This examination was performed to see if a surf shop / ice cream business would be successful. 

# Results

## 3 Differences
- The maximum temperature of June was 85 while December was 83.
- The average temperature of June was 3.9 degrees higher than December.
- The bottom quartile was 73 in June and 69 in December. 

# Summary
## Conclusion
If it can be assumed that people will eat ice cream and surf at temperatures around 70 degrees, it seems that year-round the temperature is consistent enough, with a variation of about only 4 degrees, for this business to be sustainable.

## Additional Queries
Additional years needed to be included in this query because it is possible that temperatures can vary more over a longer period.

Other areas of Oahu should be considered for the different climates because a surf shop not near the beach might not be as successful as one right on the beach.
